Secure message chat application for get a diploma in SEUA
I have created a web app using Asp.net core, SignalR, DB MSSQL and JS/JQuery. The idea of the application is to provide a secure chat environment. The chat is working with P2P concept. The server does not save messages in database. The messages are stored in cookies of browser in the client side. Encryption of the messages is done in client side using RSA and AES algorithms, which do chat more secure from the “man-in-the-middle” attack. (Deployment Azure)
